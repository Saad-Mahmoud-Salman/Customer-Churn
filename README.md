Customer Churn Analysis using Power BI
This repository contains the Customer Churn Analysis project for Databel using Power BI. The purpose of this project is to analyze customer churn patterns, identify key factors influencing customer retention, and present insights through interactive Power BI dashboards.

Project Overview
Customer churn is an important metric for businesses. Understanding the reasons behind customer attrition can help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention. In this project, I analyzed churn patterns and created interactive visualizations to present actionable insights for improving retention strategies.
