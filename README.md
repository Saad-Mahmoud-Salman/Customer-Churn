# Customer Churn Analysis using Power BI

This repository contains the **Customer Churn Analysis** project for **Databel** using **Power BI**. The purpose of this project is to analyze customer churn patterns, identify key factors influencing customer retention, and present insights through interactive Power BI dashboards.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is an important metric for businesses. Understanding the reasons behind customer attrition can help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention. In this project, I analyzed churn patterns and created interactive visualizations to present actionable insights for improving retention strategies.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Understanding  
- Checked the quality and consistency of the data.  
- Explored customer demographics, contract details, and subscription types.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Performed analysis to identify trends and patterns in the data.  
- Compared churned vs. retained customers using visualizations.

### 3. Power BI Dashboard  
- Built an interactive dashboard with visuals showing customer behavior, contract types, and churn rates.  
- Added filters for deep dive analysis into different customer segments.

### 4. Insights & Recommendations  
- Identified key drivers of churn, such as contract type, customer service interactions, and subscription plans.  
- Proposed data-driven recommendations to improve customer retention.

## Key Insights

- Customers on month-to-month contracts have a higher churn rate.  
- Frequent customer service interactions are correlated with higher churn.  
- Offering incentives for long-term contracts can reduce churn.

Power BI was used to transform raw data into meaningful insights, providing a better understanding of customer behavior and retention.
